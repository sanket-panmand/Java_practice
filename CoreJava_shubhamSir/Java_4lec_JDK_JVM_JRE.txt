JDK, JVM, JRE ?

=====================================
JDK - Java Developement Kit
JRE - Java Run time Environment
JVM- Java Virtual Machine

JDK - 
It is a
Java Software Development environment which is used to develop java application.

JDK includes :
   1)JRE
   2)Development Tools (javac, javadocs, java etc)
   
================================================================   
   JRE -

It provides environment to run java program

   includes-
   1)implementation of JVM
   2)classes required to run the java program
   3)property files
   
=================================================================

JVM -

- We called it as virtual machine because it is not physically exists.
- it is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which java bytecode is execuated.
-JVM is responsible to run your program.

includes-
     1)ClassLoader(Loading, Linking and byte code verifying)
	 2)Execuation work
	 3)main methods calls by JVM.
	 4)jvm also called as interpreter.
	 
===============================================================
   
   
   Java Variables
   
   int a = 10;
   
   Types of Variables
 
     1)local variables
	 2)instance variables /global variable
	 3)static variables
	 

	 static - static  - ok
	 staic - nonstatic - not ok
	 nonstatic - static  - ok
	 nonstatic - notstatic - ok
======================================================================
	 
	public class Test {
int b =10;    //  global variable / instance
static int c = 20;  // static variable
 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hi.......");
		System.out.println(c);
		Test aa = new Test();
		aa.print();
	}
	
	
	public void print() {
		int a = 10;    //local variable
		System.out.println(a);
		System.out.println(b);
		System.out.println(c);
	}
