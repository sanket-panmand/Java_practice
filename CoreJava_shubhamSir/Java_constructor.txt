Constructor
======================================================
Types of constructor

1.Default constructor
2.parameterized constructor

- constructor is special method
- it doesn't have return type
- if you are writing return type to constructor it is then behaving as method of the class
- it is block of codes similar to the method.
- it is called when object of class is created.
- constructor name is similar as of class name.
- a constructor must have no explicit return type;
- constructor is used to initialize the class instance(global) varibles;


==================================================================
Imp notes :


-In the  class we can have multiple parametrized constructor.
-but we can have only one default constructor in the same class.
- if you are writing parametrized constructor in a class then it is mandatory to write default constructor.
- and if parametrized constructor is not written then you can or cannot write default constructor.

example

//Default Constructor

	public Vehicle() {
                                                    
	}
	


//Parametrized Constructor

	public Vehicle(String vehicleName,int noOfWheels, String companyName) {
		this.vehicleName = vehicleName;
		this.noOfWheels = noOfWheels;
		this.companyName = companyName;
	}
	
	public Vehicle(String vehicleName,int noOfWheels) {
		this.vehicleName = vehicleName;
		this.noOfWheels = noOfWheels;
	}
	
	public Vehicle(String vehicleName) {
		this.vehicleName = vehicleName;
	}
==================================================================================


	public Fan(String fanName, int wings, int price) {   //parametarized constructor
		super();
		this.fanName = fanName;
		this.wings = wings;
		this.price = price;
	}

	public Fan() {      //default constructor
	}
	
	
	
	
	
=======================================================================
		
	
creation of object using default and parametarized constructor

	   Fan fan = new Fan();                   // calling default constructor
		
		Fan fan2 = new Fan("bajaj",4,500);  // calling parametrized constructor
		
		System.out.println(fan2.fanName);
=========================================================================

Copy Constructor :

Copy constructor in a java is a special constructor used to create new object by copying all the state of existing object of same class.
This is we can typically used when we want to create a new object that is an exact copy of an existing object.


example--


	
	// Copy constructor
	public Books(Books book) {
		this.title = book.title;
		this.author = book.author;
		this.price = book.price;
		this.publicationYear = book.publicationYear;
		
	}


------------------

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Books book1 = new Books();
		book1.setTitle("Yayati");
		book1.setAuthor("V. S. Khandekar");
		book1.setPrice(1200);
		book1.setPublicationYear(2001);
		
		
		Books book2 = new Books(book1);
		System.out.println(book2.getTitle());
	

	}

Constructor Overloading :

crating multiple parametrized constructor with different arguments in it calling as constructor oveloading

===================================================

Constructor chaining :

calling the one constructor from another constructor in the same class or its superclass.
Usually we are using this  to avoid code duplication and to ensure that common initialization takes place.

Two types of constructor chaining:
1)calling one constructor from another constructor of a same class.(within same class)
we are using this keyword to call so.

ex -  public Books(String title, String author, int price, int publicationYear) {
		this(title,author);

		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;
		this.price = price;
		this.publicationYear = publicationYear;
		
		
	}


      public Books(String title, String author) {
		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;
		
	}

2)calling parent constructor from child constructor(Between superclass and subclass)
ex - 	public Books() {
		super();
	}
