Type Casting
==================================================

Type casting is a process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
It is done by placing the desired type in parantheses before the variable.

1)Primitive Type Casting
    
	This involves converting between  primitive data types to another primitive data types.
	ex- convering int to double and vice versa.
	
	 
	 Casting Type :
	 
	   a)Implicit casting(widening casting)(automatically)   
		   - convering smaller data type to longer data type
		ex:-   
		int a = 10;       
		double d = a;  
		
		
		ex2:	  
		  ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange
		  
		      char ch = 'H';   
              int num = ch;     
                  
            System.out.println(num);      //Prints  ASCII value
				 
			Note: When you are converting char type to any other numric data type typethen it will
                  give you ascii value of that element.			
	      
	   
	   b)Explicit casting(Narrowing Casting)(manually)
	   
	      - converting a large data type to a smaller size data type
		ex:  
		  double d = 56.67;
		  int a =(int) d;
