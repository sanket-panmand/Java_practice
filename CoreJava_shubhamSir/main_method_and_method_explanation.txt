Main Method :

- Main method is a starting point(entry point) of your java project to start the execuation(run) of program.
- without main method we cannot run the java program.
-Every java applicaton(project)has atleast one class and one main method.


access modifier - visibility(to access) is decided by access modifier
======================================================================
public
private
default
protected

public - the public modifier makes it accessible from anywhere in the application.
           hence JVM can call this method from anywhere

static - The static keyword makes your main method as class method
          so that it can be called by class name without creating object of the class.
        -JVM load the class into te memory and call the main method without creating object of that class.

void - (return type) - which returns nothing
main Method -> it is method name.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

variables:

- variables are used to hold(store) the data.
   ex.-> int num1 = 98;
  so here num1 -> is a variable


                                    
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		    int a = 30;
		    int b = 50;
		    int sum = a + b;
		    System.out.println(sum);
		    
		
	} 
	
   
   Types of Variables
 
     1)local variables 

         are the variables which present inside the method.

	 2)instance variables /global variable / public variables

         - are the variables which presents inside class  but outside the method

	 3)static variables
	 - it is only present inside the class body, but we cannot create static varible inside the method.
