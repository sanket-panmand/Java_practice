JAVA MAP
=================================================

-Map is always work with key and value pair.
-key - should be unique
- value can be anything.
-Map is not a sub type of collection
- map is an interface so you cannot create object of map 
- when you are passing object as key we need to overider the hashcode and equals method in that class.
--default size is 16 -(bucket of hashmap)
-  where your key is unique.
-So here one object is used as key and another object used as value.  
-If you try to insert duplicate key , it will replace the present element by current one.

when to use map -

- when there is a condition where we want to use association of key and value pair.
-when someone wants to retrieve(fetch) and update or add the elements by key.


comman example-
1)a map of error codes and there description
2)map of city and pincode
3)a map of rollnum and name of student

syntax -
 
 Map<String, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
 

characteristics of map
1)key should be unique and value can be anything
2)in some map implementation like hashmap and linkedhashmap null key and value are allowed
but in treemap it is not allowed
3)map is always wporks on hashing principle -(hashcode() and equals() method)



example-

	Map<String, Integer> m = new LinkedHashMap<>();
		m.put("EMP5060",35000); 776hh8
		m.put("EMP5051",45000);
		m.put("EMP5059",49000);
		m.put("EMP5060",100000);776hh8
		
		

		for(Map.Entry<String,Integer> aa : m.entrySet()) {
			System.out.println(aa.getKey()+":"+aa.getValue());
			
		}
		
        System.out.println("========================");
		m.remove("EMP5060");
		for(Map.Entry<String,Integer> aa : m.entrySet()) {
			System.out.println(aa.getKey()+":"+aa.getValue());
			
		}
	}


========================================================================================

hashcode() method
equals() method

hashcode() method-
 - it is used to get hashcode of an object.
 -it return the memory reference of an object in the form of integer.
 - it calculate the bucket i.e. it calcualte the index.
 
 equals() method -

- this method used to check weather 2 objects are equal or not.
-it comapres the key whether they are equal or not. If equals() method return true then they are
equal othewise not.


  Que) What is contract in between hashcode() and equals() method ?
   
   Ans ->
   A contract is: 
   If two objects are equal then they should have the same hashcode 
   and if two objects are not equal then they may or may not have same hash code.

TreeMap:

1.It implements map interface.
2.It gives you efficient way to store data in key and value pair in sorted order.
3.It provide you faster rapid fetching(rettrieval).
4.tree map gives you feature that its elements will be sorted in an ascending order.
5.Java treemap class it is a red-black tree based implementation.- red-black tree is BST(self-balancing binary search tree)
     -red - black is color of node
     -

6.It contains only unique element
7.here no null key is allowed but we can have multiple null values.

TreeMap<String,Integer> tp = new TreeMap<>();
		
		tp.put("Nike", 5000);
		tp.put("Addidas", 3000);
		tp.put("Puma", 4000);
		tp.put("Goldstar",5000);
		
		for(Map.Entry a :tp.entrySet()) {
			System.out.println(a.getKey()+" "+a.getValue());
		}
		
        System.out.println(tp.descendingMap());
